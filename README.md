## Testing
I believe to my best knowledge that the website works well. I have tested the website and its links to different browsers and on different devices. Sometimes the loading times depend on the device and internet speed. All the links within website opens in a new tab taking the user exactly where intended.

All different sections has been adjusted to their specific resolution. Decreasing the screen size places the websites sections underneath each other. Same for tables within the pages decreases padding and adjusts image size.

The menu disappeared when scrolled down to first image and fundamentals section. Took longer then expected to resolve the issue.
