## Features Left to Implement

## Testing
I believe, to my best knowledge, that the website works well. I have tested the website and its links to different browsers on a variety of different devices. Sometimes the loading times depend on the device and internet speed. All the links within the website open in a new tab taking the user where intended.

All different sections have been adjusted to their specific resolution. Decreasing the screen size places the websites sections underneath each other, decreases table padding, and adjusts image size.

The menu disappeared when scrolled down to the first image and fundamentals section. It took longer then expected to resolve this issue.
## Validator Testing
* HTML
    * No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator
* CSS
    * No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator
*Accessability
     * I confirm that the colours and fonts chosen are easy to read and accessible by running it through lighthouse in devtools.
